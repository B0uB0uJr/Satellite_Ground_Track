# Satellite_Ground_Track
This Python project is designed to track and plot the ground trace of a satellite, based on its orbital parameters. It generates plots of the satellite's position over time, using projections of Earth to visualize its movement. The script can also optionally animate the satelliteâ€™s trajectory on a global map.

# Satellite Ground Trace Plotter

This project plots the ground trace of a satellite based on its orbital parameters. It uses Python libraries such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `Basemap` to generate 2D visualizations of a satellite's path on Earth. It supports both static plotting and optional animations.

## Features

- Plots the ground trace of a satellite over time.
- Supports various map projections.
- Optional animation to visualize the satellite's movement dynamically.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `Basemap`
- `datetime`

You can install the necessary dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib basemap
