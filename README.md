# Satellite_Ground_Track
This Python project is designed to track and plot the ground trace of a satellite, based on its orbital parameters. It generates plots of the satellite's position over time, using projections of Earth to visualize its movement. The script can also optionally animate the satelliteâ€™s trajectory on a global map.
